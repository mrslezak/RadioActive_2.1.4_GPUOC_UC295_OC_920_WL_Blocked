# Radioactive Kernel 2.1.4 Op8/Pro/8T OOS + 295mhz UC 800/920mhz GPU OC and Adreno Boost set to low
# Thanks to acuicultor for this great kernel!  I just added what I like to keep it fast while
# not pulling too much battery, built with Proton Clang 12 for my personal use.  For best results,
# use his installation AnyKernel3 zip and replace the Image.gz and dtb with this one, flash via
# EX Kernel Manager or FK Kernel Manager.  A default WL blocklist has been added that improves
# screen drain by quite a bit, which is on automatically (Boeffla).  The official XDA page for releases:

# THIS IS NOT A PROPERLY COMMITTED REPO, LIKE I SAID, FOR MY PERSONAL USE, BUT USE IF YOU LIKE
